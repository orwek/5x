5x
==

Originally intended as a collection of browser games for mobile devices based on a 5x5 grid. 5x has now become a collection of JavaScript games that utilize the DOM for the user interface rather than the HTML5 canvas element.

This project will also be the primary test for the **andi** framework (www.github.com/orwek/andi).
